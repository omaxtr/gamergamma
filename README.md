## The Philosophy: Retro Simplicity
Gamer Gamma is built for those who miss the "just works" efficiency of classic utilities like **Gamma Panel**. Unlike modern apps that are cluttered with 3D effects, heavy animations, and complex menus, Gamer Gamma goes back to basics: **Simple, high-response sliders that do exactly what they say.**

No 3D fluff. No account required. Just pure control over your pixels.

## Tactical Gaming Advantage: "Daylight in the Dark"
Built specifically for high-tension **FPS games (Valorant, CS, Tarkov, Dark Souls)**, Gamer Gamma gives you a professional tactical edge:

*   **Black Stabilizer (LG-Style Logic)**: Unlike standard brightness, this uses a non-linear power curve to lift dark shadows. Enemies hiding in pitch-black corners become visible while preserving the overall contrast of the game.
*   **White Stabilizer**: The highlight equivalent of the Black Stabilizer. Smoothly adjusts bright areas without instantly washing out the image.

## Setting Guide

### 1. Levels (The Basics)
*   **Brightness**: Overall display gain.
*   **Contrast**: Control the depth between light and dark (Default: **1.0**).
*   **Saturation**: Make those game colors pop or go moody grayscale.

### 2. Stabilizers (The Pro Tools)
*   **Black Stabilizer**: The "LG Style" feature. Smoothly lifts shadows using a gamma curve. **Essential for spotting enemies.**
*   **White Stabilizer**: Smoothly adjusts highlights and bright regions.
*   **Mid-Gamma**: Adjusts the "belly" of the curve. Use this to shift the weight of the image, making it feel overall brighter or moodier without affecting true blacks or whites (Default: **0.0**).
*   **Black Floor**: Performs a surgical "floor cut". Forcefully lifts dark pixels into visibility. More aggressive than the stabilizer.
*   **White Ceiling**: Sets a "hard ceiling" for brightness. Prevents highlight clipping and protects your eyes from "flashbang" whites.

### 3. Extras
*   **Black Level**: Fine-tune the absolute black floor of your monitor. Shifting this shifts the whole image spectrum.
*   **Hue**: Shift the entire color spectrum for creative or corrective effects.
*   **Dither**: Dramatically reduces color banding on lower-quality panels by adding subtle noise.

## System Integration
*   **Flexible Hotkeys**: Bind any combination (e.g., **Ctrl+1**, **Alt+F1**) to switch profiles instantly mid-match.
*   **Profiles**: Save custom setups for different games or lighting conditions.
*   **Minimize to Tray**: Send the app to the system tray (Lightbulb icon) to keep your workspace clean.
*   **Auto-Persistence**: Remembers your last used settings, monitor selection, and "Minimize to Tray" state automatically.
*   **Start with Windows**: One-click toggle to have the app launch and apply your settings in the background every time you boot.
